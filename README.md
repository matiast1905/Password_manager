# Password Manager
Device based password manager implemented in python using the sha256 hash function to encrypt the passwords.
The passwords are saved in a database, which can be saved in a public server.
The only thing that must remember secret is the master key created by the user.

## TODO
  * Implement a synchronization of the database with a web server
